# AI Assistant - RAG API Integration Complete ✅

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Correct API Endpoint**
- ✅ Changed from: `https://nr-test.onrender.com/chat`
- ✅ Changed to: `https://nr-test.onrender.com/api/rag`

### 2. **Correct Request Format**
- ✅ Changed parameter from `message` to `query`
- ✅ Simplified request (removed conversation_history)
- ✅ Using native `fetch` API instead of axios

**Request Format:**
```javascript
{
  "query": "What is space debris?"
}
```

### 3. **Correct Response Parsing**
Your RAG API returns:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "answer": "Space debris, also known as space junk, refers to...",
  "apod": {  // Optional: APOD image data when relevant
    "title": "Lunar Eclipse in Two Hemispheres",
    "date": "2025-09-12",
    "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/...",
    "hdurl": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/...HD.jpg"
  }
}
```

Updated code to extract `data.answer` (or `data.answer.result`) and optional `data.apod` for images.

### 4. **Authentication Requirement**
- ✅ Chatbot only visible to **signed-in users**
- ✅ Button doesn't appear on login/landing pages
- ✅ Appears after user authenticates

### 5. **APOD Image Display (NEW!)** 🎨
- ✅ Displays NASA APOD images when RAG API includes them
- ✅ Shows image below text answer
- ✅ Includes metadata (title, date)
- ✅ Clickable HD image link
- ✅ See: `APOD_IMAGE_FEATURE.md` for details

## ✅ API Test Results

### Successful Test:
```powershell
$body = '{"query":"What is space debris?"}'; 
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://nr-test.onrender.com/api/rag" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Response:**
```
ok    : True
answer: @{result=Space debris, also known as space junk, refers to man-made objects orbiting Earth...}
```

✅ **API is working perfectly!**

## 📋 Updated Code

### Endpoint Configuration
```javascript
const CHATBOT_API_URL = 'https://nr-test.onrender.com/api/rag';
```

const response = await fetch(CHATBOT_API_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: userMessage  // Changed from 'message' to 'query'
  }),
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(120000)
});
```

### Response Parsing
```javascript
const data = await response.json();

// Extract answer.result from RAG API response
if (data.answer && data.answer.result) {
  botContent = data.answer.result;
}
```

### Authentication Check
```javascript
// Only show if user is authenticated
if (!isAuthenticated || !user) {
  return null;
}
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### First Message (Cold Start):
```
User: Types "What is LEO?"
UI: "Waking up AI service... ⏱️ First request may take up to 2 minutes"
[30-120 seconds wait]
AI: "LEO stands for Low Earth Orbit, which is an orbital altitude between 160-2000 km..."
```

### Subsequent Messages:
```
User: "What about MEO?"
UI: "AI is thinking..."
[2-5 seconds]
AI: "MEO stands for Medium Earth Orbit, located between 2,000-35,786 km..."
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If chatbot button doesn't appear:
1. Check if user is logged in
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
3. Check console (F12) for errors

### If "API Error" appears:
1. Check if https://nr-test.onrender.com/api/rag is online
2. Test API directly with PowerShell command above
3. Check Render.com logs for errors

### If response is weird/formatted incorrectly:
- Response parsing updated to handle `answer.result`
- Should work with your RAG API format
- If still issues, check console.log output
