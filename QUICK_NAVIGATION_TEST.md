- ❌ **Stays on same page** - Link not working, check href
- ✅ **Returns to landing** - CORRECT!

### AI Timeout:
- ❌ **Still says "2 minutes"** - Need to hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- ❌ **Says different time** - Wrong message, check code
- ✅ **Says "30 seconds"** - CORRECT!

### Navigation Buttons:
- ❌ **Button doesn't respond** - Check onClick handler

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Logo still goes to /country
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

3. Check console for errors: F12 → Console tab

### Issue: AI still says "2 minutes"
**Solution:**
