# AI Assistant - Error Fix Summary

## üîß What Was Fixed

### 1. **Improved Error Handling**
Added detailed error messages to help diagnose issues:
- Timeout errors now show helpful message about cold start
- Network errors show connectivity issue
- API errors display status code and details
- All errors logged to console for debugging

### 2. **Increased Timeout**
- Changed from 30 seconds to **60 seconds**
- Accounts for Render.com free tier cold start
- First request can take 30-60 seconds to wake up service

### 3. **Better User Feedback**
- Welcome message now mentions 30-60 second wait for first message
- Loading indicator shows different message for first request:
  - First: "Waking up AI service... ‚è±Ô∏è First request may take 30-60 seconds"
  - After: "AI is thinking..."
- Clear visual feedback about what's happening

### 4. **Improved Response Parsing**
Now handles multiple response formats:
- `response.data.response`
- `response.data.message`
- `response.data.answer`
- Direct string responses
- Falls back gracefully if format unexpected

### 5. **Better Headers**
Added `Accept: application/json` header for compatibility

## üéØ Current Error: Cold Start Delay

### What's Happening:
Your chatbot API is hosted on **Render.com free tier**, which puts inactive services to "sleep" after 15 minutes. When a user makes the first request:

1. Request sent to https://nr-test.onrender.com/chat
2. Render detects service is asleep
3. Spins up container (20-40 seconds)
4. Loads dependencies (10-20 seconds)
5. Finally processes request
6. **Total: 30-60 seconds for first request**

### After First Request:
- Service stays awake for ~15 minutes
- Subsequent requests: 2-5 seconds
- Much faster experience!

## üêõ If Still Getting Errors

   If times out ‚Üí API is down
   ```

2. **Check Browser Console**
   ```
   Press F12
   Look for detailed error message
   "Chatbot API error:" will show cause
   ```

3. **Try This PowerShell Test**
   ```powershell
   $body = '{"message":"test"}'; 
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://nr-test.onrender.com/chat" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" -TimeoutSec 90
   ```
   
   If this works ‚Üí Website should work
   If this fails ‚Üí API issue
